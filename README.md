# Boilerplate-webpack-react

## Instroduction

This is a simple boilerplate project to start fast with Reactjs, webpack and
gulp.

This includes some webpack loaders like [image-webpack-loader](https://www.npmjs.org/package/image-webpack-loader)
for optimizing images and other cool things like [Hot Module Replacement](http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/)
for React.

## Usage

Copy this repo.

### Webpack-dev-server:

* Run `gulp`
* Open http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/

When running, you can edit HelloWorld.react.jsx and save it, your edits will
be visible without reloading.

### Build for server:

* Run `gulp build`

This will create the minified build files
